# Top-2000-Subreddits
This project contains my exploratory data analysis on the Top 2,000 communities on reddit.com

My analysis can be found in the Top-2000-Subreddits-Analysis.Rmd file.

My data-scraping process can be found in two R scripts:
reddit_scraping_script.R contains the function I use to extract data from the webpage.
reddit_scraping_urls.R runs the scraping function on all necessary URLs and combines them into my final data.
